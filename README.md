# solutions-algebra-chapter-0
An (unofficial) solution manual for exercises in "Algebra: Chapter 0", which is an algebra textbook written by Paolo Aluffi.

There are a few important points to note here:
+ The solution is *only* hosted on my GitHub page [https://github.com/choco-bear/solutions-algebra-chapter-0].  
   If you find this document outside this page, you might have an outdated version of the solution which might have errors, so please be aware.
+ I will update the solution irregularly.
+ If you found an error in the solutions, typos, bad grammar or want to give an advise on LaTeX formatting, etc., don't hesitate to open an issue or a pull request on my repo.
